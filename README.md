# Java Simple Calculator

## Description
Java Simple Calculator is a basic console application that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program takes two numbers and an arithmetic operator as input from the user and displays the result.

## Features
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Handles unsupported operations with an error message

## Installation
1. Make sure you have [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java_SimpleCalculator.git

   
## Usage Example
Enter the first number
5
Enter the operation (+,-,*,/)
*
Enter second number
3
5.0 * 3.0 = 15.0


## If the user enters an unsupported operation:

Enter the first number
4
Enter the operation (+,-,*,/)
%
Enter second number
2
The specified operation is not supported by the calculator


## Future Improvements

Add support for more complex operations like exponentiation and modulus

Implement input validation to prevent invalid numbers or division by zero

Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction

Allow continuous calculations without restarting the program
